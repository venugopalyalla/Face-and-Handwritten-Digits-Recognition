Steps to run the code in this folder: Faces_In_The_Wild_Code
1)	Copy the AutoEncFaces file and paste in the folder containing Faces in the Wild data.
2)	Run the script.
3)	Now code word representations are created by the auto encoder.
4)	The MSE and PSNR errors for the reconstructed images are displayed on the console.

Steps to run the code in this folder: MNIST_CODE
1)	Copy the MnistAutoEncoder file and paste in the folder containing Mnist data.
2)	Run the script.
3)	Now code word representations are created by the auto encoder.
4)	We can implement classifiers like KNN or Neural network using these code word representations.
5)	To classify using KNN, please run the KnnClassifier script.
6)	To classify using Neural network, please run the NeuralClassifier script.


To run PCA
- simply run Dataset_PCA in MATLAB where Dataset needs to be replaced by either MNIST or Faces.
- Add suitbale path locations within the code to suit the path requirement.
